<h1>ABOUT ME<h1>

Hi, I am Roqa, from UdeM hub, PhD student at University de Montreal in biomedical sciences.
My research interests are on neurodegenerative diseases and their effects on individuals. Throughout my master's program, I specialized in medical imaging, which provided me with knowledge of diagnostic and imaging techniques utilized in the field. However, for my PhD, I need to familiarize myself with the state-of-the-art data science packages.

#Project Summary

My project aims to elucidate and compare the distinct functional connectivity patterns between individuals with Parkinson's disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms (PD+NPS) and those without the condition, using resting-state fMRI connectivity matrices.

##Specific objectives include:

Characterizing the functional connectivity alterations in individuals with PD+NPS by examining the connectivity matrix derived from resting-state fMRI data.
Identifying and mapping disrupted functional brain networks associated with PD+NPS and investigating their potential relevance to motor and neuropsychiatric symptomatology.
Comparing the functional connectivity patterns between individuals with PD+NPS and healthy controls to delineate the specific network alterations unique to the PD+NPS population.
